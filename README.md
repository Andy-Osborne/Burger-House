# Burger House
Milestone One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This fictional restaurant website was built to illustrate the skills I have acquired in using HTML, CSS and bootstrap and will be used to form part of my portfolio as I continue to hone my current skills and acquire further ones. 

This website was built for a prospective client who wanted to have a minimilistic yet stylish website that used neutral colours within its design and be responsive on their customer’s media devices such as laptops, mobiles and tablets.

## Demo
A live demo of the website can be found [here](https://andy-osborne.github.io/Burger-House/jobs.html).

## UX

### User stories

As a business owner we want to showcase our restaurant with a minimilistc design so it doesn’t distract the customer from what we have to say and offer.  

1)	We want our customers to feel at home on our page which is why want neutral colours such as blue 
2)	We want our website to be intuitive so customers can easily navigate themselves around our website and find what they were after with minimal effort.
3)	We want an interactive menu that our customers can use and navigate to various offerings we provide them.
4)	We want a simple job section that will display what jobs we have available and an easy to use navigation so the user can get in touch with us. 

As a customer, we want to be able to navigate easily to the various sections of the website and have ease of use, no matter what device we are using. 


### Strategy

### Scope

### Structure

### Skeleton

### Surface

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.0.0)

## Features

### Features Left to Implement

I want to add google maps to the website however; this was implemented during the initial development stage and removed. The reason for this is google maps requires a paid API key in order to correctly show the map on your website without an error message pop-up. It was felt that showing the map and having this message on it takes away an element of professionalism away from the website.

I want to add a Javascript booking form onto the contact page that will allow a user to interact with it and place a booking online for their relevant party size. 

## Testing

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named `index.html`.

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/Andy-Osborne/Burger-House.git` into your terminal. To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.

## Credits

### Content
All the content on the website was written by me, including the restaurant menu items and descriptions. 

### Media
All the photos used on the website were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), which is a stock image library.

The Burger House logo was created by Rebecca Catlin for me to use for this project.  

### Acknowledgements
The carousel feature was modelled after the bootstrap component and I would like to thank Sonar Systems and their YouTube tutorial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8ItscKLf7s) for understanding on how to implement it correctly. The overall carousel was modiied to allow the use of cards within the carousel itself and have a text box to display the job role and blurb.  

The sticky footer was created using the Flexbox technique tutorial provided by Css-tricks [site](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/). This assisted me with coding the footer so it always stuck to the bottom of the webpage. 

The CSS code used to create the interactive menu section was based around the code example provided on [site](https://alligator.io/css/css-only-click-handler/) although this was heavily modified to fit the purpose of creating a menu. 

The icon logos were provided from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), which provide free to use icons.
